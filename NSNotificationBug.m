This bug arises when using NSNotificationCenter in conjunction with asynchronous operations. If an object is deallocated before its observer is removed from the notification center, a crash may occur when the notification is posted after the object's deallocation. This is because the notification center attempts to send a message to a deallocated object which results in an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.
